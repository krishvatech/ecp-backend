"""
Interactions app

Provides real-time user interactions for events:
- Chat messages (persisted)
- Q&A submissions (persisted and answerable)

This package is paired with Channels consumers (see interactions/consumers.py)
and registered in INSTALLED_APPS so Django discovers models and migrations.
